# Inner Products

Just as measuring quantities is critical in engineering and science, so to is it important in mathematics.
For example, when working with vectors one often wishes to know "how similar are these two vectors?" --- a question that every STEM practitioner knows to solve via the *dot product*.
It is perhaps unfortunate, however, that far fewer STEM practitioners understand the dot product as an *inner product*.
In fact, I would posit that very few engineers even know what the inner product is and how incredibly useful it is to engineering.
It is my belief that this lack of understanding might come from simply a disconnect between the theory and application, one that I hope to at least partially correct.

As an engineer myself, I like to think of *tools* that I can use to solve problems --- we often give tools names that describe what they do: hammer, screwdriver, pliers, vice grip, drill, etc.
While I'm not going to rename the inner product, let me at least provide a simplified description of what this tool does:

> Inner Product
> : a tool that allows us to compare two objects of similar type, allowing us to measure them.

There is, obviously, a more rigorous definition of an inner product but this description is a good mental model for the purpose of inner products. At the end of this chapter I'll provide the standard description of the inner product that will allow you to recognize an operation as an inner product.
But for now, let me just show you how my simplified description of the inner product works.

## Notation

Before we do that though, let me define the notation that I will use to represent the inner product between two objects:

$$
\Inner{\cdot}{\cdot}
$$

where each $\cdot$ is a placeholder for one of the two objects.

## The Inner Product on the Real Numbers

Overly simplified, the real numbers, represented by $\Real$, are the types of numbers you encounter routinely in your everyday life.
This includes numbers like 0, or 1, or 147, as well as 1.4 and -0.9, and $\sqrt{2}$ and $\pi$.

$$
\Inner{a}{b} := ab, \quad a,b \in \Real
$$

This is simply *scalar multiplication* between two numbers, so how does this let us compare two objects?
Well, we can compare $\Inner{a}{b}$ against $\Inner{b}{b}$ by dividing the former by the latter:

$$
\frac{\Inner{a}{b}}{\Inner{b}{b}}
$$

Which gives us the comparisons:

- $\frac{\Inner{a}{b}}{\Inner{b}{b}} = 1$
  - This tells us that $a$ is equal to $b$, $a = b$
- $\frac{\Inner{a}{b}}{\Inner{b}{b}} = -1$
  - This tells us that $a$ is the additive inverse of $b$, $a = -b$
- $\frac{\Inner{a}{b}}{\Inner{b}{b}} > 1$
  - This tells us that the magnitude of $a$ is larger than the magnitude of $b$, $\abs{a} > \abs{b}$.
- $\frac{\Inner{a}{b}}{\Inner{b}{b}} < 1$
  - This tells us that the magnitude of $a$ is smaller than the magnitude of $b$, $\abs{a} < \abs{b}$.

Furthermore, if we simplify the expression comparing the two inner products, $\frac{\Inner{a}{b}}{\Inner{b}{b}}$, we find $\frac{a \cdot b}{b \cdot b} = \frac{a}{b}$, in plain English: the inner product is providing us a *ratio* between the two numbers.
So how is this useful?
Let's consider this example:

::: {.callout-note icon=false appearance="simple"}
## Example
Imagine that you have two unknown values.
You are able to compare them against each other using the inner product, but do not yet actually know the value of either.
You compare the two inner products and find $\frac{\Inner{a}{b}}{\Inner{b}{b}} = -\frac{1}{16}$.
Now suppose that sometime later you are able to compare $a$ against the number $2.5$ and find $\frac{\Inner{2.5}{a}}{\Inner{2.5}{2.5}} = -1.6$.
You now *instantly* know that $a = -.25$ and $b = 4$.
:::

In the above example, the inner product allowed us to compare two objects, and when you can compare two objects *you can measure them*.
But perhaps this was too simple to be convincing, as we noticed it is simply scalar multiplication and division.
Let's look at a more interesting application of inner products next:

## The Inner Product of Real Vectors

For two vectors consisting of real numbers

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
  \vec{x} &= [ x_{\Index{1}}, \cdots, x_{\Index{n}} ]^T, &\quad x_{\Index{i}} \in \Real, \ \forall \Index{i} \ \in [1, \Index{n}] \\
  \vec{y} &= [ y_{\Index{1}}, \cdots, y_{\Index{n}} ]^T, &\quad y_{\Index{i}} \in \Real, \ \forall \Index{i} \ \in [1, \Index{n}]
\end{align*}
```

the inner product, which we previously stated is also known as the *dot product*, is defined as

```{=latex}
\begin{equation*}
  \Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}} = \vec{x}^T \vec{y} = \sum_{\Index{i}=1}^{\Index{n}} x_{\Index{i}} y_{\Index{i}} = x_1 y_1 + \cdots + x_{\Index{n}} y_{\Index{n}}
\end{equation*}
```

And again, we ask the question: *"how does the inner product allow us to compare and/or measure vectors?"*
As before we can compare the vectors against each other via

```{=latex}
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}}}{\Inner{\vec{y}}{\vec{y}}}
\end{equation*}
```

Which allows us to understand the relative orientation of the vectors:

- $\frac{\Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}}}{\Inner{\vec{y}}{\vec{y}}} = 0$
  - This tells us that $\vec{x}$ is orthogonal (perpendicular) to $\vec{y}$.
- $\frac{\Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}}}{\Inner{\vec{y}}{\vec{y}}} > 0$
  - This tells us that the angle between $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ is acute ($<90^\circ$).
- $\frac{\Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{y}}}{\Inner{\vec{y}}{\vec{y}}} < 0$
  - This tells us that the angle between $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ is obtuse ($>90^\circ$).

While the evaluation of

```{=latex}
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{x}}}{\Inner{\vec{y}}{\vec{y}}}
\end{equation*}
```

allows us to compare the lengths of the vectors:

- $\frac{\Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{x}}}{\Inner{\vec{y}}{\vec{y}}} = 1$ 
  - This tells us that $\vec{x}$ is the same length as $\vec{y}$.
- $\frac{\Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{x}}}{\Inner{\vec{y}}{\vec{y}}} > 1$ 
  - This tells us that $\vec{x}$ is longer than $\vec{y}$.
- $\frac{\Inner{\vec{x}}{\vec{x}}}{\Inner{\vec{y}}{\vec{y}}} < 1$ 
  - This tells us that $\vec{x}$ is shorter than $\vec{y}$.

## The Inner Product of Real Functions
Given two real functions[^2], $f$ and $g$, the inner product is

```{=latex}
\begin{equation*}
  \Inner{f}{g}_{L^2} \coloneqq \int_{\Omega}{ f g } \ d\Omega
\end{equation*}
```

which is also known as the $L^2$ inner product.
The norm induced by the $L^2$ inner product is the $L^2$-norm

```{=latex}
\begin{equation*}
  \| f \|_{L^2} \coloneqq \sqrt{ \Inner{f}{f} }
\end{equation*}
```

Since we'll be dealing with the $L^2$ inner product quite a bit, let's consider some examples

### Example 4.4.1

```{matlab}
%| output: false
x = sym( "x", "real" );
f = sin( x );
g = sin( x );
L2 = int( f * g );
```

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= \sin(x) \\
  g(x) &= \sin(x) \\
  \Inner{f(x)}{g(x)} &= \frac{1}{2} ( x - \sin(x) \cos(x) ) \\
\end{align*}
```

```{matlab}
%| echo: false
domain = sym( [0, 2*pi] );

figure
subplot( 2, 1, 1 )
hold on
fplot( f, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$f(x)$" )
fplot( g, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$g(x)$" )
axis padded
grid on
legend()

subplot( 2, 1, 2 )
fplot( L2, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$\langle f(x), g(x) \rangle$" )
axis padded
grid on
legend()
```

Where evaluating the inner product provides us with a function of the domain:

And, for example, the inner product on the domain $[0,2\pi]$ is then

```{matlab}
%| output: false
f = sin( x );
g = sin( x );
L2 = int( f * g, domain );
```

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
  \Inner{f(x)}{g(x)}_{[0, 2\pi]} = \pi
\end{equation}
```


### Example 4.4.2

```{matlab}
%| output: false
f = sin( x )
g = -1 * sin( x )
L2 = int( f * g )
```

Where evaluating the inner product provides us with a function of the domain:

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= \sin(x) \\
  g(x) &= -\sin(x) \\
  \Inner{f(x)}{g(x)} &= \frac{1}{2} ( \sin(x) \cos(x) + x) \\
\end{align*}
```

```{matlab}
%| echo: false
domain = sym( [0, 2*pi] );

figure
subplot( 2, 1, 1 )
hold on
fplot( f, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$f(x)$" )
fplot( g, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$g(x)$" )
axis padded
grid on
legend()

subplot( 2, 1, 2 )
fplot( L2, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$\langle f(x), g(x) \rangle$" )
axis padded
grid on
legend()
```
And, for example, the inner product on the domain $[0,2\pi]$ is then

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
  \Inner{f(x)}{g(x)}_{[0, 2\pi]} = -\pi
\end{equation}
```

### Example 4.4.3

```{matlab}
%| output: false
f = sin( x )
g = cos( x )
L2 = int( f * g )
```

Where evaluating the inner product provides us with a function of the domain:

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= \sin(x) \\
  g(x) &= \cos(x) \\
  \Inner{f(x)}{g(x)} &= \frac{\sin(x)^2}{2} \\
\end{align*}
```

```{matlab}
%| echo: false
domain = sym( [0, 2*pi] );

figure
subplot( 2, 1, 1 )
hold on
fplot( f, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$f(x)$" )
fplot( g, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$g(x)$" )
axis padded
grid on
legend()

subplot( 2, 1, 2 )
fplot( L2, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$\langle f(x), g(x) \rangle$" )
axis padded
grid on
legend()
```
And, for example, the inner product on the domain $[0,2\pi]$ is then

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
  \Inner{\sin(x)}{\sin(x)}_{[0, 2\pi]} = 0
\end{equation}
```

### Example 4.4.4

```{matlab}
%| output: false
f = sin( x )
g = sin( 2*x )
L2 = int( f * g )
```

Where evaluating the inner product provides us with a function of the domain:

```{=latex}
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= \sin(x) \\
  g(x) &= \sin(2x) \\
  \Inner{f(x)}{g(x)} &= \frac{\sin(x) - \sin(x)\cos(2x)}{3} \\
\end{align*}
```

```{matlab}
%| echo: false
domain = sym( [0, 2*pi] );

figure
subplot( 2, 1, 1 )
hold on
fplot( f, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$f(x)$" )
fplot( g, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$g(x)$" )
axis padded
grid on
legend()

subplot( 2, 1, 2 )
fplot( L2, double( domain ), LineWidth=2, DisplayName="$\langle f(x), g(x) \rangle$" )
axis padded
grid on
legend()
```

And, for example, the inner product on the domain $[0,2\pi]$ is then

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
  \Inner{f(x)}{g(x)}_{[0, 2\pi]} = 0
\end{equation}
```
