# Writing an FEM Code

The first portion of this text introduced the finite element method with a focus on "seeing the math", with not much thought given to performance nor development best practices.
The next major portion of this text will focus on developing a (moderately) performant FEM code using good, if not best, software development practices.
We will use the same general framework for our software as we did in the previous portions of this text, however, and will utilize previously-written routines to aid development.
