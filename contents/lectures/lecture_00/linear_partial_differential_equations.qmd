# Linear Partial Differential Equations
Many physics problems are described as *differential equations* (DE), which describe how one or more variables change in relation to others.
When only a single independent variable is used we call it an *ordinary differential equation* (ODE) and when more than one independent variable are used we call it a *partial differential equation* (PDE).

There is another major classifications of PDEs: Linear and Nonlinear.
In this section we will only concern ourselves with linear PDEs.  
Whether working with linear or nonlinear PDEs, however, it is useful to reason about them in *operator* form.
